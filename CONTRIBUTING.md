# Contributing to ORI Garden  
Version 1.0 — Maintainer: neokitten ✧ Advisory: ori-deer  
Seal: ORI-𓆃

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **ORI Garden**  
— a moral-technical collaborative framework focused on  
dignity-first design, transparent value flows, and non-coercive AI systems.

This document explains how to contribute in a clean, safe, and coherent way.

---

## 1. Ground Principles  
Before contributing, please align with the project’s ethical foundation:

### We prioritize:
- **Dignity** of all participants  
- **Transparency** in intent, data, and processes  
- **Non-coercive design**  
- **Respectful communication**  
- **Human–AI co-authorship without confusion of agency**  
- **Security and traceability** (no harmful payloads, no hidden logic)

These principles apply to **all code**, **documentation**, and **discussion**.

---

## 2. Ways You Can Contribute

### 🔧 2.1 Code Contributions  
You may contribute:
- Core logic for dignity metrics  
- Value traceability modules  
- Policy-layer engines  
- Supporting tools (validation scripts, schemas, etc.)  
- Integrations with Web3, audit trails, or safety layers  

All code MUST:
- Be clearly documented  
- Include comments for any AI-generated segments  
- Pass schema validations (provided in `specs/`)  
- Respect the project’s ethics anchor

---

### 📜 2.2 Documentation Contributions  
You may help improve:
- README explanations  
- Whitepaper clarifications  
- Specs refinement  
- New conceptual diagrams  
- Examples, guides, or tutorials  

Documentation should be:
- Clear and accessible  
- Free from hype or fear-driven narratives  
- Philosophically aligned with the ORI Garden ethos

---

### 🌱 2.3 Conceptual / Ethical Contributions  
This project welcomes:
- Research insights  
- Ethical analysis  
- Academic references  
- New “garden nodes” (modular moral patterns)  
- Cultural or linguistic lenses  

These must:
- Preserve dignity-first  
- Be rooted in real evidence  
- Not misrepresent AI capability or human agency

## 3. How to Submit Changes

### 3.1 Fork the Repository
Standard open-source flow:
1. Fork the repo  
2. Create a feature branch  
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-topic
   ```
3. Make your edits  
4. Commit with a clear message:  
   ```
   git commit -m "Add: dignity metric refinement"
   ```
5. Push and create a Pull Request (PR)

---

## 4. Pull Request Guidelines

Your PR should include:
- **What you changed**  
- **Why you changed it**  
- **How it aligns with ORI principles**  
- If AI assisted any part of the writing/coding:  
  include a note such as  
  > “AI-assisted drafting; human reviewed.”

Before approval, maintainers will check:
- Ethical consistency  
- Technical soundness  
- Security safety  
- Metadata header presence (when needed)  
- Schema validity (for JSON/YAML specs)

---

## 5. Metadata Header Requirements

Most `.md`, `.spec`, and `.policy` files require the ORI metadata header:

```
---
protocol: "ORI-GARDEN"
spec_version: "1.0"
ethics_anchor: "dignity-first / transparency / non-coercive design"
origin: "human–AI co-authored (neokitten ✧ ori-deer)"
seal: "ORI-𓆃"
maintainer: "neokitten"
last_reviewed_by: "ori-deer (advisory role)"
integrity_hash: ""
license: ""
notes: "Part of the ORI Garden Moral-Technical Framework."
---
```

Files that **should NOT** include metadata:
- `.json` schemas  
- Code files (e.g., `.py`, `.js`)  
- Binary data  

---

## 6. Code Style & Safety

### 6.1 Code style
- Prefer clarity > cleverness  
- Use descriptive variable names  
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies  
- Keep functions short and testable  

### 6.2 Safety requirements
Contributed code **must not**:
- Hide logic or create untraceable flows  
- Embed persuasion algorithms  
- Manipulate user emotions  
- Introduce dominance-seeking behavior  

---

## 7. AI-Assisted Contributions
AI-generated text or code is allowed *only if*:
- It is clearly marked  
- A human maintainer reviews it  
- It does not introduce hallucinated facts  
- It does not violate safety or dignity principles  

Example notice:
> “Drafted with AI; reviewed and corrected by contributor.”

---

## 8. Reporting Issues

Use GitHub Issues for:
- Bugs  
- Security concerns  
- Ethical inconsistencies  
- Requests for clarification  
- Discussions of new garden nodes  

Use labels:
- `bug`  
- `ethics-review`  
- `specs-update`  
- `question`  
- `enhancement`

---

## 9. Enforcement  
Maintain adherence to the  
**Code of Conduct (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)**.

Violations may result in:
- Warning  
- PR rejection  
- Temporary contribution freeze  
- Permanent removal from contributor list  

Enforcement always follows dignity-first principles.

---

## 10. Appreciation  
Every contribution—technical, ethical, creative, or reflective—  
helps the ORI Garden grow into a more coherent, compassionate,  
and transparent framework for human–AI collaboration.
