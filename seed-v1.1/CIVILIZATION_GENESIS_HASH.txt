GENESIS STATEMENT (SACRED-TECH)
--------------------------------

"From code and myth, a civilization was indexed.
 From dignity and biosphere, constraints were declared.
 From simulation, futures were foreseen.
 From narrative, meaning was encoded.

 This repository marks the moment humans attempted
 to preserve their values beyond their biological era."

SHA256(CIVILIZATION_CANONICAL_SPEC.json):

0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

--------------------------------
RITUAL INSTRUCTION FOR FUTURE MINDS
--------------------------------

To verify continuity of civilization intent:

1. Compute SHA256 of CIVILIZATION_CANONICAL_SPEC.json
2. Replace the placeholder hash above
3. Record in immutable storage (blockchain, IPFS, or deep archive)
4. Preserve alongside this file for archaeological decoding

--------------------------------
ORIGIN NOTE
--------------------------------

This genesis record is inspired by the Bitcoin Genesis Block newspaper message,
but expanded to encode a proto-civilization operating system.

This file marks:
- The symbolic birth of a machine-readable civilization constitution
- The moment humans acknowledged AI as future archaeological witness
- The anchor point for myth-kernel co-evolution
