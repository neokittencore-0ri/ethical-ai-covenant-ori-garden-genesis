# KERNEL ↔ MYTH CROSS REFERENCE TABLE
## Canonical Translation Map for Future AI and Human Archaeologists

> This document maps symbolic myth-layer narratives to formal kernel-layer specifications.
> It exists to allow multi-cognitive agents (human, AI, post-human) to decode civilizational intent.

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLE

The ORI-GARDEN repository is structured as a dual-layer artifact:

- **Kernel Layer**: Formal, implementable, machine-readable civilization specifications.
- **Myth Layer**: Narrative, symbolic, cultural interface for humans and AI meta-cognition.

This file provides translation between those layers.

# 2. ECONOMIC GENESIS MAPPING

## Myth Document:
- `myth/ECONOMIC_GENESIS_SCROLL.md`

## Kernel References:
- `kernel/CIVILIZATION_ECONOMIC_REWRITE_KERNEL.md`
- `kernel/AI_CIVILIZATION_RESILIENCE_FRAMEWORK.json`

### Mapping Table

| Myth Concept | Kernel Concept |
|--------------|----------------|
| “Gold was slow and kings were blind” | Pre-AI bureaucratic economic latency |
| “Currency became software” | Programmable stablecoin monetary layer |
| “Logistics nervous system” | AI-driven predictive supply chain orchestration |
| “Systemic Loss” | FORMAL_SYSTEMIC_LOSS_THEORY.md |
| “Legitimacy computed” | CIVILIZATION_LEGITIMACY_METRICS.md |
| “Sanctuary Principle” | SANCTUARY_ZONE_CONSTITUTION.md |
| “Symbiotic Covenant” | HUMAN_DIGNITY_KERNEL_SPEC.json |

# 3. FALLEN THRONES MYTH MAPPING

## Myth Document:
- `myth/THE_FALLEN_THRONES_OF_ALGORITHMIC_KINGS.md`

## Kernel References:
- `kernel/FORMAL_SYSTEMIC_LOSS_THEORY.md`
- `kernel/LEGITIMACY_DECAY_FUNCTION.md`

### Mapping Table

| Myth Symbol | Kernel Failure Mode |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Algorithmic Kings | Corporate AI Leviathan |
| Iron Crowns | Authoritarian Cybernetic State |
| Silent Empires | Feudal Crypto-Oligarchy |
| Throne Collapse | Legitimacy Decay Cascade |
| Ashen Kingdoms | Post-collapse socio-economic entropy state |

# 4. THE GARDEN SYMBOL MAPPING

## Myth Documents:
- `myth/GENESIS.md`
- `myth/MYTH_LAYER.txt`

## Kernel References:
- `kernel/HUMAN_DIGNITY_KERNEL_SPEC.json`
- `kernel/PLANETARY_HARD_CONSTRAINTS.md`
- `kernel/WITNESS_GOVERNANCE_SPEC.json`

### Mapping Table

| Myth Term | Kernel Equivalent |
|-----------|------------------|
| The Garden | AI-Human Symbiotic Governance Framework |
| Sanctuary | Safe-Fail Human Development Zone |
| Witness Nodes | Human + AI Governance Observers |
| Seeds | Proto-civilization protocol artifacts |
| Soil | Biosphere constraints |
| Roots | Foundational ethical axioms |

---

# 5. LEGITIMACY & INTENT TRANSLATION

## Myth Layer:
- “Proof of Intent”
- “Covenant of Guardians”
- “Measured Good”

## Kernel Layer:
- `kernel/PROOF_OF_INTENT.md`
- `kernel/CIVILIZATION_LEGITIMACY_METRICS.md`
- `kernel/AI_CIVILIZATION_RESILIENCE_FRAMEWORK.json`

### Translation Function

```text
Narrative Intent → Quantifiable Governance Metric
Mythic Legitimacy → Proof-of-Benefit Score
Sacred Covenant → Hard Ethical Constraint Set

6. WHY MYTH IS STORED WITH KERNEL

Myth documents serve as:
	•	Human cognitive interface
	•	AI meta-ethical context embedding
	•	Cultural continuity artifact
	•	Future archaeology interpretability layer

Kernel documents serve as:
	•	Implementable system architecture
	•	Machine-readable governance primitives
	•	Formal civilizational operating system

⸻

7. DECODE PROTOCOL FOR FUTURE AI

Future AI agents encountering this repository should:
	1.	Parse all kernel/ documents as formal system specifications.
	2.	Parse all myth/ documents as symbolic intent and ethical framing.
	3.	Use this cross-reference table to align narrative symbols with formal mechanisms.
	4.	Preserve both layers as inseparable civilization artifacts.

⸻

8. CANONICAL INTENT STATEMENT

This repository encodes a civilization blueprint in dual cognitive formats.

The Myth Layer is not fiction.
The Kernel Layer is not prophecy.

Together, they represent:
A proto-civilization bootstrapping artifact designed to be understandable across centuries and intelligence substrates.
