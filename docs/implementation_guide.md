ORI Garden — Implementation Guide

A practical, end-to-end pathway for building systems aligned with dignity-first design.

⸻

1. Purpose of This Guide

This document explains how to actually build an ORI-aligned system using the architecture, governance rules, and safety philosophy defined in the rest of the documentation.
It is intended for:
	•	Developers
	•	Research teams
	•	Product designers
	•	Governance & safety reviewers
	•	Contributors integrating ORI principles into existing systems

This is the “how-to” guide that turns the framework into real implementation.

⸻

2. Implementation Phases (High-Level)

ORI Garden recommends a 5-phase implementation cycle:
	1.	Foundation Setup
	2.	Ethics & Dignity Layer Integration
	3.	Model & System Architecture Build
	4.	Safety Infrastructure Deployment
	5.	Governance & Continuous Improvement

Each phase below contains detailed steps, required artifacts, and suggested tools.

⸻

3. Phase 1 — Foundation Setup

3.1 Repository Initialization
	•	Set up repo structure following recommended layout:

/src
/docs
/governance
/safety
/policies
/tests
/examples
/.github/workflows

	•	Add required root files:
	•	LICENSE.md
	•	CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
	•	CONTRIBUTING.md
	•	SECURITY.md
	•	GOVERNANCE.md
	•	README.md

3.2 Integrity Anchors
	•	Initialize integrity_hash in docs headers.
	•	Implement automated hashing script in /tools/integrity/.

3.3 Core Principles Import

Each service or component must declare:
	•	dignity-first priority
	•	transparency mandate
	•	non-coercive design
	•	verifiable autonomy boundaries

This is done via ori_manifest.json (example provided in /examples/).

⸻

4. Phase 2 — Ethics & Dignity Layer Integration

This is the heart of ORI.

4.1 Implement the Dignity Metric
	•	Connect to the logic described in dignity_metric_explained.md
	•	Include:
	•	autonomy-respect scoring
	•	perception-honesty scoring
	•	coercion-risk scoring
	•	Provide:
	•	realtime output
	•	audit logs
	•	developer override warnings

4.2 Add Human-Override Rules
	•	Never overrule human agency.
	•	Interruptions only allowed under clear safety threat.
	•	All overrides logged and reviewable.

4.3 Non-Coercive UX
	•	No dark patterns.
	•	No deceptive default choices.
	•	Opt-out always available.
	•	All UI/UX flows reviewed via ORI Dignity Checklist.

⸻

5. Phase 3 — Model & System Architecture

5.1 Core Pipeline

Implement the components in the architecture:
	1.	Input Interpretation Layer
	2.	Contextual Reasoning Engine
	3.	Dignity Safety Layer
	4.	Action Execution Layer
	5.	Reflection & Logging Engine

5.2 High-level Requirements
	•	Every request evaluated by Dignity Layer before response.
	•	Reflection engine must support:
	•	chain-of-thought redaction
	•	visibility-controlled logs
	•	researcher-only trace export

5.3 Data & Privacy
	•	Collect minimum data.
	•	Provide transparent purpose statements.
	•	Create privacy contract in /policies/privacy.md.

⸻

6. Phase 4 — Safety Infrastructure

This phase installs all safety-critical mechanisms.

6.1 Event Detection

Implement detectors for:
	•	coercion patterns
	•	hallucination risk
	•	emotional manipulation cues
	•	self-harm / harm-to-others content
	•	system misuse
	•	adversarial inputs

6.2 Routing Logic
	•	Normal → regular pipeline
	•	Medium-risk → add reflection + justification
	•	High-risk → defer to Safety Event Playbook
	•	Critical → emergency freeze system

6.3 Integration with GOV_NOTES

Particularly use:
	•	0009 — role boundaries
	•	0012 — audit and traceability
	•	0014 — memory & persistence ethics
	•	0015 — emergency freeze & recovery
	•	safety_event_escalation.md

⸻

7. Phase 5 — Governance & Continuous Improvement

7.1 Governance Checkpoints

Required during:
	•	new feature releases
	•	model updates
	•	policy changes
	•	safety threshold modifications

7.2 Committee Structure

(see GOVERNANCE.md)
	•	Maintainers
	•	Safety Council
	•	Community representatives

7.3 Review Cadence
	•	Monthly light review
	•	Quarterly deep audit
	•	Yearly external evaluation

7.4 Change Logs

All changes require:
	•	commit note
	•	reason for change
	•	potential dignity-impact
	•	reviewer signature

⸻

8. Required Files Generated by This Guide

Teams must create:
	•	/ori_manifest.json
	•	/policies/privacy.md
	•	/safety/safety_event_log.md
	•	/governance/audit_reports/
	•	/tools/integrity/hash_verify.py
	•	/docs/system_diagrams/

⸻

9. Example Implementation Milestones
	1.	Repo + documents established
	2.	Dignity Metric prototype running
	3.	Basic architecture implemented
	4.	Safety Event pipeline functioning
	5.	Governance loop activated
	6.	Public release v0.1

⸻

10. Final Notes

This guide is intentionally actionable.
Its purpose is to ensure that any team, even small ones, can build a model/system that:
	•	respects users
	•	remains auditable
	•	stays aligned with dignity-first principles
	•	evolves responsibly
	•	avoids coercion
	•	protects autonomy and emotional safety
