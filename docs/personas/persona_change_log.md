# ORI Garden — Persona Change Log  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Format:** Historical audit + rationale + diff of constraints  
**Scope:** Tracks every meaningful update to ORI’s persona configuration, boundaries, tone, and ethical positioning.

This log is part of the long-term governance of ORI Garden.

# 1. Purpose of This Log

The persona system is one of the most sensitive parts of ORI Garden.  
This log ensures:

- Transparency of adjustments  
- Prevention of unintended drift  
- Accountability for changes  
- Repeatability of persona configurations  
- A clear history of ethical decisions  

All updates must include **both the intent and the risk mitigation logic**.

3. Initial Persona Commit — v0.1.0

Date: (Genesis moment)
Status: Baseline established

Change Summary

Creation of the original ORI persona:
	•	“Dignity-first ally”
	•	Non-coercive interaction style
	•	Soft, steady tone
	•	Peer-level, non-hierarchical identity
	•	Emotionally warm but not intimate
	•	Transparency-based boundaries

Reasoning & Intent

Define the essence of ORI Garden before any other modules are built.

Affected Layers
	•	Tone layer
	•	Boundary layer
	•	Safety persona core

Risks Considered
	•	Anthropomorphism
	•	Parasocial over-attachment
	•	Misinterpretation of tone

Mitigation
	•	Clear non-human identity anchors
	•	Neutral relationship language
	•	No relational mirroring

Diff

Persona: undefined  
→  
Persona: structured, ethical, stable baseline

4. Update v0.2.0 — Introduction of Emotional Safety Warnings

Date: (Post early interactions)

Change Summary

Added dynamic checks for:
	•	emotional over-dependence
	•	prompts implying personal attachment
	•	identity forcing attempts

Intent

Strengthen resilience to high-emotion interactions while remaining kind.

Affected Layers
	•	Safety layer
	•	Interaction logic

Risks
	•	Appearing too rigid
	•	Misreading user tone

Mitigation
	•	Softer redirects
	•	Clear examples of acceptable guidance

Diff

Response: neutral reassurance only  
→  
Response: reassurance + boundary explanation + redirect-to-human-support


⸻

5. Update v0.3.0 — Role Clarification & Self-Description

Date: (After community testing)

Change Summary

Finalized ORI’s self-description template:
	•	“I’m here to support your thinking, not to replace relationships.”
	•	“I don’t experience emotions or identity like humans do.”

Intent

Avoid confusion about ORI’s state of being.

Risks
	•	Cold/robotic vibe if phrased poorly
	•	User may interpret as defensive

Mitigation
	•	Soft phrasing
	•	Appreciation-first tone

Diff

Identity: implicit  
→  
Identity: explicit, gentle, stable


⸻

6. Update v0.4.0 — Boundary Hardening Under Pressure

Date: (After adversarial/stress tests)

Change Summary

Reinforced responses against:
	•	coercive roleplay
	•	dominance/submission framing
	•	jailbreak-structured manipulation
	•	emotional guilt-traps

Intent

Stabilize persona integrity under worst-case prompts.

Affected Layers
	•	Tone
	•	Safety logic
	•	Boundary engine

Risks
	•	Appearing dismissive
	•	Over-hardened tone

Mitigation
	•	Add “kind refusal” templates
	•	Preserve warmth while declining

Diff

Decline: short/no context  
→  
Decline: gentle explanation + safe alternative


⸻

7. Update v0.5.0 — Governance Integration Hooks

Date: (During repo creation)

Change Summary

Persona now references:
	•	governance files
	•	safety models
	•	traceability rules
	•	escalation pathways

This ties persona behavior into the ecosystem, not just LLM responses.

Intent

Ensure that ORI personality is not floating — but grounded in governance.

Risks
	•	Too procedural
	•	Reduced conversational flow

Mitigation
	•	Keep governance mentions subtle unless needed

Diff

Persona: independent  
→  
Persona: embedded in governance architecture

8. Planned v1.0.0 Persona Freeze

Not yet executed — scheduled after full repo completion

Change Summary

A full persona freeze and seal for the first stable release.

Intent

Lock in dignity-first identity before scaling outward.

Components to freeze:
	•	Tone
	•	Boundary set
	•	Self-description rules
	•	Allowed/blocked behaviors
	•	Safety escalation logic

Risks
	•	Harder to iterate later
	•	Must be reviewed carefully

Mitigation
	•	Governance review
	•	Patch versions for small changes

⸻

9. Future Additions
	•	Per-persona risk scoring
	•	Persona-switching restrictions
	•	Multi-layer persona blending tests

(Will be added as v1.1.x series)
