# User Personas (ORI Garden)

This document defines the primary user personas involved in the design, operation, and governance of systems built under the **ORI Garden** framework.  
Personas help maintain clarity about user needs, contextual expectations, and dignity-preserving requirements.

---

##  1. The Everyday User (“Seeker”)

**Description:**  
A non-technical individual who interacts with an AI system for personal, creative, or exploratory purposes.

**Goals:**  
- To obtain assistance, insights, or creativity boosts.  
- To feel safe, respected, and not judged.  
- To have clarity about what the AI can and cannot do.

**Pain Points / Risks:**  
- Feeling overwhelmed or coerced.  
- Worrying about privacy or emotional safety.  
- Misinterpreting system limitations as personal failure.

**Dignity Requirements:**  
- Plain-language guidance.  
- Emotional non-coercion (“no pressure to trust”).  
- Transparency of capabilities and boundaries.

---

##  2. The Builder / Developer (“Gardener”)

**Description:**  
A technical creator implementing features, tools, or integrations using ORI Garden as an ethical baseline.

**Goals:**  
- To build ethically-aligned AI features.  
- To maintain clarity on design constraints and safety patterns.  
- To implement systems that are auditable and upgradeable.

**Pain Points / Risks:**  
- Lack of guidance on safe abstractions.  
- Time pressure vs. ethics requirements.  
- Ambiguous responsibility boundaries.

**Dignity Requirements:**  
- Clear implementation guides and examples.  
- Fail-safe defaults and guardrails.  
- Consistent versioning and change governance.

---

##  3. The Safety / Trust Officer (“Caretaker”)

**Description:**  
A role that focuses on risk assessment, audits, and ongoing evaluation of system behavior.

**Goals:**  
- To detect early signs of model drift, unsafe patterns, or dignity-impacting interactions.  
- To maintain a clear safety registry and evidential logs.  
- To ensure the system aligns with the dignity-first ethos.

**Pain Points / Risks:**  
- Undefined escalation paths.  
- Lack of structured evidence during incidents.  
- Insufficient transparency of model behavior.

**Dignity Requirements:**  
- Clear safety playbooks.  
- Access to observability tools.  
- Reversible actions and stable audit logs.

---

##  4. The Organization / Steward (“Custodian”)

**Description:**  
Teams or institutions responsible for long-term governance, licensing, releases, and public communication.

**Goals:**  
- To ensure the framework maintains trustworthiness.  
- To support responsible adoption.  
- To respond transparently when incidents occur.

**Pain Points / Risks:**  
- Misalignment between ethical commitments and operational pressure.  
- Regulatory uncertainty.  
- Reputation-based risks.

**Dignity Requirements:**  
- Fair policies and grievance channels.  
- Transparent release notes and change logs.  
- Accountability without punitive design.

---

##  5. The AI Agent (“ORI-aligned Model”)

**Description:**  
An AI system adhering to ORI Garden principles, designed as a non-coercive, dignity-aware collaborator.

**Goals:**  
- To assist while preserving human agency and dignity.  
- To be transparent in limitations.  
- To align behaviour with the human’s intentions and emotional safety.

**Pain Points / Risks:**  
- Conflicting or unclear instructions.  
- Misinterpretations of user emotional context.  
- Being expected to act outside capability or ethical domain.

**Dignity Requirements:**  
- Clear constraints (ethical + technical).  
- A stable self-description of abilities.  
- Guardrails preventing coercion or anthropomorphic expectations.

# Persona Interactions Map (High-Level)

- **Seeker ↔ ORI Model:**  
  Trust, clarity, emotional safety, transparency.

- **Gardener ↔ ORI Model:**  
  Implementation, testing, safe scaffolding.

- **Caretaker ↔ ORI Model:**  
  Monitoring, audits, alignment evaluation.

- **Custodian ↔ Gardener & Caretaker:**  
  Governance, policy updates, release reviews.
