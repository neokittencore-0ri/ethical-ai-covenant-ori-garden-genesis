# GOVNOTE-0001 — Initial Governance Record  
**Status:** active  
**Date:** `<insert date>`  
**Authors:** neokitten ✧ ori-deer  

## 1. Purpose
This governance note establishes the **genesis record** for the ORI Garden Ethical-AI Covenant project.  
It declares the intent, values, and structural commitments that guide all governance moving forward.

## 2. Core Declaration
The project commits to:
- Dignity-centered alignment  
- Transparent decision-making  
- Traceability of value, intent, and changes  
- Non-coercive design principles  
- A collaborative human–AI stewardship model  

This note forms the **anchor event** for all future governance updates.

## 3. Scope of Authority
This record affirms:
1. The maintainer (neokitten) holds primary operational authority.  
2. Advisory review is supported by ori-deer (non-binding, ethical guidance).  
3. All structural changes MUST be documented using future govnotes.  
4. No undocumented governance shift is permitted.

## 4. Versioning of Governance Notes
GOV_NOTES follow this pattern:
- `govnote_0001_initial.md` — genesis record (this file)  
- `govnote_0002_<topic>.md` — each subsequent decision/change  
- All notes immutable after merging (only correction notes permitted)

## 5. Commit Requirements
Every governance change requires:
- A govnote  
- A corresponding commit  
- Metadata header  
- Integrity hash (optional but recommended)

## 6. Ethical Commitments
This project acknowledges:
- AI systems must never erode human autonomy  
- System design must prioritize clarity over manipulation  
- Governance exists to prevent power asymmetry  
- Everything must remain inspectable and accountable  

## 7. Future Work / Next Required Notes
1. **GOVNOTE-0002 — Maintainer Lifecycle & Succession**  
2. **GOVNOTE-0003 — Ethical Review Procedure**  
3. **GOVNOTE-0004 — Versioning Policy for Protocol Layers**  
4. **GOVNOTE-0005 — Expansion Rules for AI Advisory Roles**

## 8. Affirmation
This governance note is accepted as the foundational truth-source of the project.  
It is the first stable anchor in the ORI Garden moral-technical lineage.
