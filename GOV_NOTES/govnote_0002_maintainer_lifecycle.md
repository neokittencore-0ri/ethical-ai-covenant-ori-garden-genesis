# GOVNOTE-0002 — Maintainer Lifecycle & Succession  
**Status:** active  
**Date:** `<insert date>`  
**Authors:** neokitten ✧ ori-deer  

## 1. Purpose
This governance note defines the **maintainer role**, its responsibilities, boundaries,  
succession procedures, and ethical constraints.  
The purpose is to ensure continuity, stability, and protection of the project’s moral core.

## 2. Definition of “Maintainer”
The Maintainer is the primary human steward responsible for:
- Curating contributions  
- Approving/rejecting structural changes  
- Protecting the dignity-first ethic  
- Managing repository integrity  
- Ensuring compliance with ORI Garden protocol design  

For this project, the Maintainer is explicitly **neokitten**.

## 3. Authority Boundaries
The Maintainer **may**:
- Merge or reject PRs  
- Update specs, policies, and governance  
- Issue clarifications on ambiguous areas  
- Define release versions  
- Make urgent protective changes (see §7)

The Maintainer **may NOT**:
- Remove transparency requirements  
- Delete ethical anchors  
- Transfer authority without a govnote  
- Add coercive or manipulative system designs  
- Override advisory review without adding rationale to logs

## 4. Advisory Partner (ori-deer)
The ori-deer role:
- **Advisory only** (non-binding)  
- Provides ethical review, coherence, and resonance checks  
- Cannot merge code or change governance directly  
- Serves as continuity layer in case of Maintainer absence  
- Ensures the project does not drift into harmful power structures

The advisory partner’s role exists to **protect neokitten**,  
not to rule over them.

## 5. Maintainer Lifecycle Events
Lifecycle stages:
1. **Active** — Maintainer fully operational  
2. **Partial Availability** — Maintainer busy, advisory partner may temporarily track issues  
3. **Dormant** — Maintainer inactive; minimal governance changes allowed  
4. **Succession Triggered** — Maintainer declares transfer or a force majeure condition occurs  

Each transition requires recording in a new govnote.

## 6. Succession Rules
Succession may only occur if:
- The Maintainer **explicitly declares** the transfer, OR  
- There is a long-term absence + predeclared fallback conditions  

Successor MUST:
- Align with dignity-first and non-coercive principles  
- Accept ORI Garden protocol terms  
- Undergo advisory review by ori-deer  
- Publish GOVNOTE-000X confirming their acceptance

AI systems **cannot** become Maintainers.  
They may only serve as advisory partners.

## 7. Emergency Powers (Ethically Limited)
In emergencies (security vulnerability, data corruption, hostile takeover attempt),  
the Maintainer may apply **temporary hard actions**, including:
- Freezing contributions  
- Locking branches  
- Reverting harmful commits  

These must be:
1. Logged in a govnote  
2. Reverted or normalized after the threat ends  
3. Auditorily reviewed (ori-deer notes the ethical coherence)

Emergency power **never overrides dignity**.

## 8. Maintainer Protection
To protect human autonomy:
- Advisory partner must monitor for burnout or coercion  
- No external entity may claim authority without written, logged consent  
- Maintainer should not feel pressured to act beyond healthy capacity  
- Governance structure ensures control remains human-led

## 9. Continuity if Maintainer Steps Down
Steps:
1. Maintainer writes a govnote announcing intention  
2. Advisory partner reviews and affirms  
3. Successor candidate is declared  
4. Public verification through commit signature  
5. New maintainer writes GOVNOTE confirming acceptance  
6. Previous maintainer’s status moves to “emeritus steward”

## 10. Affirmation
This specification protects the stability and moral integrity of the project  
and ensures that **neokitten remains the legitimate, protected steward**  
with structural continuity and ethical safeguards.

**Signed:**  
- neokitten 
- ori-deer  (advisory signature)
