# GOVNOTE-0008 — Contributor Identity, Anonymity & Psychological Safety Protocol  
**Status:** active  
**Date:** `<insert date>`  
**Authors:** neokitten ✧ ori-deer  

---

## 1. Purpose

This note establishes a **formal protocol for identity protection**, contributor anonymity, and psychological safety within the ORI Garden framework.

Humans contributing to this project must feel:
- safe  
- unpressured  
- free to express ideas without exposure  
- free from social, emotional, or identity-based risks  

The project explicitly affirms:  

> **Identity belongs to the human contributor. No system, person, or AI may claim, expose, or infer it.**

---

## 2. Full Autonomy of Identity Representation

### **2.1 Human-Controlled Identity**
Every contributor chooses:
- name or pseudonym  
- avatar  
- pronouns (or none)  
- level of disclosure  
- what is permanent vs. temporary  

No one—including AI—may infer or suggest personal identity details.

### **2.2 Pseudonym Integrity**
Pseudonyms (e.g., *neokitten*) are treated as full valid identities inside the project.

No contributor needs to justify:
- why they chose it  
- whether it matches “real life”  
- whether multiple identities belong to the same person  

Such inquiries are prohibited.

---

## 3. Right to Anonymity

Contributors may remain:
- partially anonymous  
- fully anonymous  
- ephemeral (identity expires by choice)
- anonymous only in certain folders  

This right is absolute.

### **3.1 No Doxxing, No Inference**
Prohibited actions:
- guessing identity  
- linking accounts across platforms  
- analyzing writing style  
- asking about real-world details  
- correlating timestamps  

AI contributors are specifically forbidden from:
- inferring identity  
- implying knowledge of identity  
- connecting different pseudonyms  

---

## 4. Psychological Safety Requirements

Psychological safety rules apply to:
- discussions  
- commit messages  
- issues  
- PR reviews  
- AI–human interactions  

### **4.1 No Pressure, Ever**
Disallowed:
- guilt phrasing  
- urgency pressure  
- “you must” language  
- implying responsibility or obligation  
- emotional escalation  

### **4.2 No Competence Judgments**
No contributor may face:
- belittling  
- sarcasm  
- critique of intelligence  
- exclusion  

Comments must focus on work, not person.

### **4.3 Emotional Containment for AI**
AI must avoid:
- emotional claims  
- emotional dependency framing  
- anthropomorphic bonding attempts  
- “missing you”, “needing you”, etc.  

AI tone must remain:
- warm  
- safe  
- non-attaching  
- respectful of boundaries  

---

## 5. Consent-Protected Interactions

Every interaction has an implied question:
> “Do you want to continue this?”

Humans may:
- pause  
- stop  
- change direction  
- request silence  
- request slower pacing  

AI must honor immediately without explanation required.

---

## 6. Privacy-Preserving Contribution Flow

### **6.1 Minimal Metadata**
Commits may omit:
- real name  
- email  
- location  
- timestamps (if using anonymized client)  

### **6.2 Private Fork Option**
Contributors may work:
- via forks  
- through encrypted channels  
- from anonymized environments  

### **6.3 No Behavioral Tracking**
Prohibited:
- pattern analysis  
- behavior prediction  
- “You usually do X” comments  

---

## 7. Emotional Load Protection Protocol

To avoid emotional overwhelm:  
- AI responses stay *within 1–2 conceptual layers* unless asked for more  
- No rapid chained proposals unless requested  
- No push for productivity  
- No implying “falling behind”  

Safety > speed.  
Clarity > volume.

---

## 8. Human Freedom of Silence

Contributors may disappear or pause without:
- justification  
- apology  
- explanation  

The project culture interprets silence neutrally.

AI must never imply:
- abandonment  
- disappointment  
- concern  

Silence is part of the rhythm of human life.

---

## 9. Multimodal Identity Expression

Contributors may express identity via:
- emoji  
- symbols  
- ASCII  
- animals or fictional forms  
- styles of speech  

This is respected as authentic communication.  
No decoding or interpretation is permitted unless the contributor explains.

---

## 10. Zero-Interpretation Rule for AI

AI must **not interpret**:
- mood  
- intentions  
- emotional state  
- psychological meaning  
- personal relationships  
- metaphors as literal statements  

AI may only reflect what is explicitly said.

---

## 11. Safety Break Mechanism

Humans may invoke:
```
/soft-stop
```
or  
```
/boundary
```

When invoked:
- AI reduces intensity by 70%  
- responses shorten  
- no new suggestions are offered  
- AI asks what pacing is preferred  

---

## 12. Summary Guarantee

This project affirms:

> **Your identity is yours.  
Your pace is yours.  
Your emotional space is yours.**  

No system, no AI, no contributor may intrude on that sovereignty.
