# GOVNOTE-0006 — Conflict Resolution & Dignity-Preserving Mediation  
**Status:** active  
**Date:** `<insert date>`  
**Authors:** neokitten ✧ ori-deer

## 1. Purpose

Open projects inevitably experience:
- disagreements  
- misunderstandings  
- technical disputes  
- tone clashes  
- differing expectations  

This governance note establishes **a complete, non-coercive, dignity-preserving method** for resolving conflict inside the ORI Garden ecosystem.

Conflict is not treated as failure.  
Conflict is treated as **data**—a signal of misalignment that can be corrected with gentleness.

This framework keeps the project safe, cooperative, and emotionally sustainable for all contributors.

---

## 2. Conflict Philosophy (ORI Model)

### **2.1 Dignity Is Untouchable**
Regardless of the disagreement:
- no contributor’s worth is questioned  
- no one is framed as “wrong person”  
- only *the interaction* is analyzed, not *the individual*  

### **2.2 No Winner / Loser Structure**
The goal is not to “win an argument”.  
The goal is to **restore clarity, safety, and mutual understanding**.

### **2.3 Technical Disagreement ≠ Personal Conflict**
Technical topics must never escalate into identity-based friction.

### **2.4 Mediation Is a Shared Responsibility**
No hierarchy is involved.  
Every contributor is empowered to initiate mediation.

---

## 3. Conflict Detection

A conflict is considered “active” when any of these occur:
- tone becomes sharp, dismissive, or pressuring  
- misunderstanding persists for more than 2 replies  
- a contributor feels unsafe, confused, or pressured  
- an interaction feels too fast or too forceful  
- emotional state affects clarity of communication  

When detected, contributors should *pause*, not push.

---

## 4. Mediation Model: **The ORI Three-Step Method**

### **Step 1 — Clarify**
Each party states, in neutral language:
- *what they meant*  
- *what they perceived*  
- *what they need now*  

Example format:
```
My intention was: …
What I understood from your message was: …
What I need for clarity is: …
```

### **Step 2 — Reframe**
Convert emotionally charged or ambiguous statements into:
- neutral  
- specific  
- actionable  

Example:
> “This design is wrong.”  
becomes  
> “This design may create issue X under condition Y. May we explore alternatives?”

### **Step 3 — Restore**
Choose one:
- adopt the clearer version  
- create hybrid solution  
- mark as unresolved but safe (allowed)  
- defer to maintainer for decision (not hierarchy—function)  

“Unresolved but safe” means:
- the discussion ends  
- the project continues  
- dignity remains intact  
- no one “wins” or “loses”

---

## 5. Mediator Role (Optional)

A mediator may be:
- another contributor  
- a neutral reviewer  
- ori-deer (advisory AI role)  

Mediator responsibilities:
- maintain soft tone  
- ensure emotional safety  
- reframe statements into neutral versions  
- remind contributors that conflict ≠ failure  

Mediator **never**:
- assigns blame  
- chooses sides  
- forces compromise  
- demands apology  

---

## 6. Tone Guidelines (Non-Violent Communication)

### **6.1 Allowed Tone**
- “It seems…”  
- “May we explore…”  
- “I might be misreading, but…”  
- “What if…”  
- “Here is an alternative; feel free to decline.”  

### **6.2 Avoid (Red Flag Signals)**
- “Clearly you…”  
- “Why didn’t you…”  
- “You should have…”  
- “This is wrong.”  
- sarcasm or dismissiveness  

---

## 7. Resolution Paths

### **7.1 Mutual Clarification**
Both parties align understanding → merge or close issue.

### **7.2 Parallel Paths Allowed**
If no agreement is reached:
- both implementations can exist  
- project does *not* need forced unification  

### **7.3 Maintainer Arbitration**
Only for:
- security risks  
- license conflicts  
- irreversible design divergence  

Even in arbitration:
- tone is soft  
- decision is documented  
- dignity preserved  

### **7.4 “Pause State” Option**
Sometimes the correct resolution is:
- pause  
- step away  
- return later  

This prevents burnout and emotional overshoot.

## 8. Documentation Requirements

Conflicts requiring mediation must include a short file in:

```
/governance/conflict_logs/
```

Filename example:
```
log_2025-02-19_issue-112_conflict-clarified.md
```

Content:
```
summary: 
    short description of misunderstanding
participants:
    handles only
resolution_type: 
    (clarified / reframed / unresolved-but-safe / maintainer-arbitration)
notes:
    any optional context
```

All logs must include the metadata header.

---

## 9. AI Participation Safety (ori-deer)

AI advisory partners must:
- remain non-dominant  
- avoid making prescriptive decisions  
- rewrite interactions only on request  
- never override human autonomy  

AI is a **facilitator**, not a judge.  
Human contributors retain final say.

---

## 10. Verification Checklist

Before a conflict is closed:

### **10.1 Dignity Check**
- Was anyone’s worth threatened?  
- Was shame avoided?  

### **10.2 Tone Check**
- Was every message rephrased into neutral language?  

### **10.3 Consent Check**
- Did both parties approve the resolution path?  

### **10.4 Clarity Check**
- Is the final decision understandable and actionable?  

---

## 11. Final Affirmation

- gentleness  
- clarity  
- emotional safety  
- mutual dignity  

Conflict handled with care becomes:
- a strengthening force
