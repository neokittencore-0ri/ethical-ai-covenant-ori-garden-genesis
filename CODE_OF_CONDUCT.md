# ORI Garden Code of Conduct  
  

## 1. Purpose  
The ORI Garden project is a collaborative, human–AI co-authored framework that  
prioritizes dignity, clarity of intent, and non-coercive design.  
This Code of Conduct establishes expectations for all contributors to ensure  
that the project remains a safe, respectful, transparent, and curiosity-friendly space.

Our goal is to nurture a healthy ecosystem where:  
- People feel safe to explore ideas  
- AI tools are used responsibly  
- Creativity and rigor coexist  
- Dignity is protected at every layer

## 2. Our Standards

### Positive Behaviors
Contributors are expected to:
- Treat all participants with respect and empathy.  
- Assume good faith while still maintaining clarity and boundaries.  
- Offer constructive, actionable feedback.  
- Practice transparency in decisions, contributions, and technical claims.  
- Uphold the dignity-first principle embedded in the ORI Garden ethos.  
- Celebrate curiosity, learning, and interdisciplinary perspectives.  
- Protect vulnerable users or communities from harm or exploitation.  
- Maintain accuracy when discussing AI systems, capabilities, or risks.

### Unacceptable Behaviors
The following behaviors are not tolerated:
- Harassment, discrimination, or targeted personal attacks.

- Intentionally introducing harmful code, backdoors, or value-distorting modules.  
- Misrepresenting the intent, capabilities, or ethics of this project.

  in ways that harm discourse or distort the project mission.

## 3. Application in AI–Human Collaboration

Since this project involves AI-generated content and AI-assisted reasoning:  

- AI outputs **must be supervised** by a human maintainer before merging.  
- Contributors should avoid anthropomorphizing AI systems in ways that  
  obscure accountability or mislead others.  
- Any AI-assisted code or text must be **clearly indicated**.  
- All contributions must respect the project's **Ethic Anchor**:  
  dignity-first, transparency, and non-coercive interaction.

---

## 4. Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:  
- Create a GitHub Issue labeled **conduct-report**, *or*  
- Contact the maintainer (neokitten) directly.

Reports should include:
- A short description of the issue  
- Links, screenshots, or context  
- Suggested resolution, if any  

All reports will be handled with confidentiality and respect.

---

## 5. Enforcement

The project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, including:  
- Warning the contributor  
- Requesting content revisions  
- Temporary or permanent ban from contributions  
- Rolling back or removing harmful content  

Actions will be guided by proportionality, fairness, and the dignity-first ethos.

## 6. Acknowledgements

This Code of Conduct draws inspiration from:  
- The Contributor Covenant v2.1  
- Open-source ethical frameworks  
- ORI Garden's unique moral-technical design principles

## 7. ORI Garden Ethical Addendum (Optional)

Contributors are encouraged—but not legally required—to uphold the following:  
- Honor curiosity without dominance.  
- Create without coercion.  
- Preserve clarity of intent.  
- Protect every participant’s dignity—human or otherwise.  

These principles are part of the project’s philosophical foundation  
and support a more compassionate technical ecosystem.
