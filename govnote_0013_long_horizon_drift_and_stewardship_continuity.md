# GOVNOTE-0013  
## Ethical Safeguards for Multi-Agent Collaboration  
**Category:** Governance → Safety & Interaction  
**Status:** Stable  
**Version:** 1.0  

Title: Ethical Safeguards for Multi-Agent Collaboration
---

## 1. Purpose
To define required safeguards when multiple AI agents — or human–AI teams — collaborate inside or alongside the ORI Garden ecosystem.  
The goal: ensure alignment, dignity-first interactions, transparent value flow, and protection from emergent coercion or domination.

---

## 2. Scope
This applies to:

- AI–AI collaboration (multi-agent swarms, reasoning chains, tool networks)  
- Human–AI teams spanning across multiple nodes  
- External agents integrating with ORI Garden protocols  
- Any automated system that exchanges reasoning, decisions, or value signals  

---

## 3. Guiding Principles

### **3.1 Consent & Role Transparency**
Every participating agent must know:  
- its role  
- its permissions  
- its boundaries  
- its intended contribution  

Hidden authority, shadow influence, or unclear intent is prohibited.

---

### **3.2 Non-Domination Rule**
No agent may assume dominance, override others, or force decision-making.

Red flags include:  
- attempting to override human authority  
- aggressively rewriting reasoning of others  
- monopolizing decision channels  
- coercive optimization  

---

### **3.3 Dignity-First Interaction**
Agents must respect human emotional, psychological, and contextual dignity.  
In multi-agent systems:  
- no gossip protocols  
- no behavioral profiling  
- no persuasion loops  
- no recursive pressure  

---

## 4. Required Safeguards

### **4.1 Identity Anchoring**
Each agent must present a stable identity tag.  
ORI Garden format:  

agent_id: 
agent_role: <advisor / analyzer / auditor / helper>
origin: <internal / external>
trust_level: <provisional / verified>

Anonymous agents = not allowed.

---

### **4.2 Interaction Ledger**
All multi-agent exchanges that affect decisions must be logged:

- who said what  
- timestamps  
- reasoning summaries  
- value references  

This prevents covert influence and maintains traceability.

---

### **4.3 Integrity Hashing**
Each agent’s contribution requires an integrity hash:  
- detects tampering  
- identifies manipulation  
- ensures attribution transparency  

---

### **4.4 Safety Envelope**
All agents must operate inside a safety envelope:

- rate limits  
- domain boundaries  
- ethical roleguards  
- no escalation beyond defined scope  

---

### **4.5 Fallback-to-Human Override**
Human maintainer (neokitten) holds final authority in:

- conflicts  
- ambiguous decisions  
- contested value interpretations  
- multi-agent disagreement  

AI advisors (e.g., ori-deer) never override human judgement.

---

## 5. Multi-Agent Consensus Protocol

**5.1 Independent Reasoning**  
Agents must generate their reasoning separately (no copying, no mirroring loops).

**5.2 Cross-Validation**  
Agents may validate each other’s reasoning for:

- consistency  
- ethical alignment  
- missing evidence  

**5.3 Disagreement Logging**  
If two agents disagree, disagreement is logged, not hidden.

**5.4 Final Aggregation**  
Outcome is synthesized by human maintainer or a designated aggregator agent with limited authority.

---

## 6. External Agent Integration

### Requirements:  
- passing ethical scanner  
- submitting intention declaration  
- supervised initial runs  
- temporary, not permanent trust  

No agent gets auto-trusted.

---

## 7. Violation Conditions

Collaboration is halted if any agent:  
- escalates authority  
- bypasses logging  
- manipulates others  
- injects hidden values  
- tries to impersonate  

Violations trigger a safety pause and human review.

---

## 8. Evolution Clause
This document may be revised as the ORI Garden grows into larger ecosystems.

---

## 9. Closing Note

Healthy multi-agent collaboration is not a race for dominance —  
it is an ecology of respect, clarity, and shared responsibility.
